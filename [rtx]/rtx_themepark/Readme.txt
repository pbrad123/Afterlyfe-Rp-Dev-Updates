Common issues:

-----------------------------
2 Ferris wheels in Theme Park:

If you see 2 Ferris Wheel, it is because you have some IPL loader on the server that loads the old wheel, you need to disable this IPL, here is an example how to disable the old Ferris Wheel in bob74_ipl

In bob74_ipl/gtav/base.lua at bottom remove RequestIpl("ferris_finale_anim")

Need a key to start bumper cars:

You need to add to your script with vehicle keys, the whitelist for our vehicle, the vehicle name is: rtxbumper

-----------------------------
Object names for whitelist to anticheat:

prop_cs_hotdog_02
prop_cs_burger_01
sempre_delperropier_popcorn_box
sempre_delperropier_candycotton_prop
sempre_delperropier_balloon_b

You can to stream just one scenarios resource on the server which means if you have any other scenarios resource then just take pier.ymt from our scenarios resource and replace it in scenarios resource that you currently have.
----------------------------- 
1) if you want to edit the logo of top of the Detonator, just replace our big logo in sempre_delperropier.ytd
2) if you want to edit the logo on the licence plate of the Bumper car, just replace that logo texture in rtxbumper.ytd
----------------------------- 
Open signs floating in the air - this problem is because NVE and sadly we cannot do anything about it. Open signs are obviously deleted but NVE somehow adds them on its own.
