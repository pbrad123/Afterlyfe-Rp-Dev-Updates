--------------------------------------------------------------


CHANGES TO FILE: fxmanifest.lua

- Updated fxmanifest to show  resource name, author, version number, url and dependencies.

Server owners are required to be on server build 3324 or higher, however FiveM and myself recommend that you update the server build to the LATEST RECOMMENDED at least once a month

 Server MUST be on gamebuild 2189 or higher for this resource to run sucessfully. I have already
provided information on how to enforce the gamebuild to 2189 or higher, don't be stupid, learn
to read.


ADDED: zones.lua

["ISHEIST"] = "Cayo Perico"

No longer shows North Yankton

Server owners / Devs can use this file with any discord rich scripts too.

4.1.5 Changes:

- Added IPL toggles to load and unload the IPLs depending on
whether or not the player is on or off the island. This was apparently the cause of Rockstar Editor (along with bob74_IPL) having issues. Far too many IPL related resources request the IPLs however never remove them when not needed.
