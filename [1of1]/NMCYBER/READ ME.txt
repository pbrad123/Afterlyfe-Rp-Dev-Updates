How to install:
    FiveM:
        Drag and drop this folder into any resource folder. Start the resource by adding: "start NMCYBER" into your server.cfg file, then restart the server.
        You can also start the resource without having to restart the server by going into server console and type "refresh", then type "start NMCYBER", but if you want to make the resource start automatically when the server starts you need to add the command in the server.cfg file.
		
Common Issus and How To Fix Them:


    "Game crashes"
    Make sure to do a DRAG & DROP intsallation of the resource without modifying anything. Also make sure the resource starts without errors. If you have further issues, contact us at https://discord.gg/northernmods or  at support@northernstudios.store.   

    "Lights are out of place or pattern looks weird"
    To fix this you need to go to the "data" folder, there find the "carcols.meta" and "carvariations.meta". Open both of them with an text editor of your choice (Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.). In "carcols.meta", on line 7 you will find "<id value="26543"/>" (the value might be different), change the number between the quotes after the value= to a random number between 500 and 40000, example: <id value="1934"/>. Then copy the number, go to the "carvariations.meta" file, on line 40 you will find "<sirenSettings value="26543"/>" (the value might be different), paste the same value from the "carcols.meta" to here, between the quotes.



    "When I start the resource it says Error parsing script / Failed to load script"
    Your server artifacts are likely outdated. Update your server to version 4752 or above.


    "You lack the required entitlement to use <resource>"
    Try restarting your server and make sure your server license key is correct. If you bought the resource on the wrong account, you can transfer it to another account on keymaster.
    (If you got this leaked, must suck)
    

    "Failed to verify protected resource"
    Files were possibly corrupted during transfer. Ensure hidden files are copied; the .fxap file in a protected resource must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files.
